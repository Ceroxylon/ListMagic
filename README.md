# ListMagic

Welcome to ListMagic V2!

This is a simple tool that takes two single column CSVs, compares them, and then spits out the difference between them in a new list/file.

Format the two lists into single column CSVs, change the pathways inside the code to your sources and preferred destination, and then run the code
in a command line / terminal using Python3 or as part of a larger application in a Python environment.

I wrote this code to solve a particular problem while crunching time sensitive data, but it has become useful in many other scenarios so I wanted to share.
Feel free to use or edit however you please.

The next version of it will have an option to scan multiple columns, and auto or manual modes that let users input pathways if desired without opening
the code.
